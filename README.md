### Tips to practice Leetcode

- Do not spend too much time
    + Easy: 10-15 mins
    + Medium: 15-20 mins
    + Hard: 20-30 mins

- Write down solutions in paper

- Solving the same data structure consecutively

### Commitment

- I commit to solve the leetcode everyday before 8:00 AM

- If I'm busy at this time, I will solve and commit before 23:00 PM at the same day.

- I will build this habit from now on (May 8, 2024)

### Future

I will open an Youtube Channel to talk about Leetcode Solution Everyday. I will solve the Leetcode Problem and push it to Youtube Short (About 20-30s) in Vietnamese. I hope that my enthusiausm will influence Vietnamese IT Teeneger to challenge themselve everyday.
